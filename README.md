## What is this book about?

Data labeling is the invisible hand that guides the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In today’s data-driven world, mastering data labeling is not just an advantage, it’s a necessity. Data Labeling in Machine Learning with Python empowers you to unearth value from raw data, create intelligent systems, and influence the course of technological evolution.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Excel in exploratory data analysis (EDA) for tabular, text, audio, video, and image data
* Understand how to use Python libraries to apply rules to label raw data
* Discover data augmentation techniques for adding classification labels
* Leverage K-means clustering to classify unsupervised data
* Explore how hybrid supervised learning is applied to add labels for classification
* Master text data classification with generative AI
* Detect objects and classify images with OpenCV and YOLO
* Uncover a range of techniques and resources for data annotation
